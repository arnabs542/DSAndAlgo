î ‹Print all paths in a tree
===========================================================================
Given a binary tree, print out all of its root-to-leaf paths one per line.
 
e.g. for a tree that's 
     1
  2     3
4 5  6 7
 
Print:
1 2 4
1 2 5
1 3 6
1 3 7

 

Key Points
====================

1. Have a running Array/ Array List that stores the levels and nodes at that level
1. Add to the list the root val and increment the level and pass to the subsequent recurisve calls
