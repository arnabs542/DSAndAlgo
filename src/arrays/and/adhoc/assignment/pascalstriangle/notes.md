Pascal's Triangle
===========================================================================
Pascal’s triangle is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. Write a function that takes an integer value n as input and prints first n lines of the Pascal’s triangle. Following are the first 6 rows of Pascal’s Triangle.

			1  
			1 1 
			1 2 1 
			1 3 3 1 
			1 4 6 4 1 
			1 5 10 10 5 1 
Key Points
====================

1. Math is very essential. Key concepts to know Binomial Coeff

2. Look for expressing any terms as a multiple or derivative of previous steps
    Here 
   <pre> 
    line          line
    	C    = 		  C	      * (line-j)/j
    	 j				j-1
</pre>

Key Questions to Ask

Approaches
====================

1. Three approaches possible
- Brute Forxe- Keep calculating binomial coeff for every entry O(n<sup>3</sup>) inefficient ( Two for loops and one loop to calculate binomial coff)
- Using Arrays
        a`[i][j]=a[i-1][j-1]+a[i-1][j]`; for all i!=0 and i!=j
    This is O(n<sup>2</sup>) but uses O(n<sup>2</sup>) space
- Keep a running product using the formula derived above
